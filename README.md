# Hi there, I'm Som Mosalagi üëã

![Profile Banner](https://your-image-link.com/banner.jpg)

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate developer with a strong background in software engineering and full-stack development. Here's a little about me, my journey, and some of the projects I've worked on.

## About Me

I did my Bachelor's in Computer Science from Pune University. In September 2020, I joined Yardi Softwares Pvt Ltd as a Software Engineer. Simultaneously, I started working for Phamoss Pvt Ltd in November 2020 as a Full Stack Developer, Application Support, and Tech Support Engineer. Phamoss is a startup in the healthtech industry. I resigned from Yardi Software in August 2022 to pursue my Master's in Software Engineering from Concordia University, Montreal, Canada. I continued working part-time for Phamoss during my master's and resigned in November 2023.

I'm currently sharpening my skills in React.js and Node.js by building various projects. I also have strong knowledge in Java and have worked with multiple frameworks and libraries.
